# web-pro — E-commerce front-end (HTML, CSS, vanilla JS)

This repository contains a small Flipkart-style e-commerce front-end built with only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It uses localStorage for products and cart state and includes a simple admin UI to add/edit/delete products.

How to use locally

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the home page.
2. Use `login.html` to set a `currentUser` and toggle `isAdmin` (for admin pages).
3. To manage products, visit `admin/admin.html` after checking "Login as admin" on the login page.

To push to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (do NOT initialize with README).
2. In this project folder run:

```powershell
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```
